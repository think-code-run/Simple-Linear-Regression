# Simple Linear Regression from Scratch
# Overview
This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model from scratch, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn. The goal is to predict employee salaries based on their years of experience using fundamental Python code and mathematical concepts.

# Project Objective
Understand Simple Linear Regression: Grasp the basic principles behind linear regression, such as calculating the best-fit line using the least squares method.
Predict Employee Salaries: Use years of experience as the independent variable to predict the dependent variable, employee salaries.
Implement from Scratch: Build the model entirely from scratch, focusing on understanding the core concepts rather than using pre-built functions.
#Task Overview
Data Exploration:

Analyze the dataset to understand the relationship between years of experience and employee salaries.
Visualize the data using Matplotlib to observe any apparent trends.
Model Implementation:

Implement the Simple Linear Regression algorithm from the ground up, using Python.
Calculate the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the best-fit line using the least squares method.
Make predictions for employee salaries based on the derived linear equation.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the accuracy of the model by calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared value.
Visualize the regression line against the actual data points to evaluate model performance.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on employee experience and their corresponding salaries. The dataset consists of the following columns:

YearsExperience: The number of years an employee has been working.
Salary: The annual salary of the employee in currency units.
# Key Features
No External Libraries: The entire model is built using core Python libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, without relying on machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.
Mathematical Approach: The project emphasizes understanding the mathematical foundation of linear regression, including the derivation of the slope and intercept.
Visualization: The use of visualizations to make the model's performance easy to interpret.
